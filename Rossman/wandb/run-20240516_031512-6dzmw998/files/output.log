/raid/ganesh/racha_suraj/miniconda3/envs/dpo/lib/python3.12/site-packages/IPython/core/interactiveshell.py:1822: UserWarning: The use of `x.T` on tensors of dimension other than 2 to reverse their shape is deprecated and it will throw an error in a future release. Consider `x.mT` to transpose batches of matrices or `x.permute(*torch.arange(x.ndim - 1, -1, -1))` to reverse the dimensions of a tensor. (Triggered internally at ../aten/src/ATen/native/TensorShape.cpp:3675.)
